Azure Cosmos DB offers two policies to run backups.

Periodic backup
Continuous backup

We can check on the backup policies which are enabled on our account, We mostly use periodic backup on our Cosmos DB's.

Periodic backup
This backup mode is the default configuration of any Azure Cosmos DB account. It runs on periodic intervals based on defined configurable periods. You can keep its retention for a month from a data recovery standpoint. 

By default, Periodic backup automatically runs every 4 hours and keeps 2 backup copies at any point of time without any cost. You can change the backup execution interval as well as its retention period to save the backup files on the storage account anytime using the Azure portal. 


If you have opted for periodic backup as your backup policy for cosmos DB accounts then one thing you must remember is that you cannot restore its backup files, you need to raise an Azure support ticket to restore or recover any data. You need to be aware that data can be restored only if the requested backup copy is from the backup retention period and not outside that retention window.

Restoration Document for periodic Backup:
The following screenshot illustrates how to create a support request for a container(collection/graph/table) to restore data by using Azure portal. Provide other details such as type of data, purpose of the restore, time when the data was deleted to help us prioritize the request.
