1. Cosmos DB

Azure Cosmos DB offers two policies to run backups.

Periodic backup
Continuous backup


By default, Periodic backup automatically runs every 4 hours and keeps 2 backup copies at any point of time without any cost. You can change the backup execution interval as well as its retention period to save the backup files on the storage account anytime using the Azure portal. 


If you have opted for periodic backup as your backup policy for cosmos DB accounts then one thing you must remember is that you cannot restore its backup files, you need to raise an Azure support ticket to restore or recover any data. You need to be aware that data can be restored only if the requested backup copy is from the backup retention period and not outside that retention window.

2. App Service:

Backup Methods:

There are two types of backups in App Service. Automatic backups are created for your app regularly as long as it's in a supported pricing tier. Custom backups require initial configuration and can be made on-demand or on a schedule

Restore App service from its Backup :

Here is the detailed procedure for app service microsoft link

3. Function App

Here is the detailed github Article to walk thorugh the region wise failure to restore the backup of a function app:

4. Key Vault

Backup and restore entire key vault and individual keys, secrets and certifications can be done either using cli or portal.
Here are the furthur steps to achive it

5. Logic App

Logic Apps has built in versioning, it's available directly in the portal. Each version can be reviewed and restored at any time.

Blob
Azure Blobs can only restored through azure backup centere to point in time

6. Fluid Relay Service:

Backup:

Export Container Content:
Use the Fluid Framework API to export the current state of the Fluid container. This involves capturing the state of the Distributed Data Structures (DDS) defined in the container1.
Store Exported Data Securely:
Save the exported data in a secure location, such as Azure Blob Storage or another secure storage solution.

Restore:

Provision a New Fluid Relay Service:
If needed, provision a new Azure Fluid Relay service in your Azure account.
Rehydrate Fluid Containers:
Use the Fluid Framework API to rehydrate the Fluid container with the previously exported data. This involves creating a new container and populating it with the saved state1.

7.Azure Kubernetes Service
To restore entire cluster we should have inbuilt backup tools for kubernets to handle the backup and restore of coantiner and clusters

8.Azure Container Registry

If a geo replication is setup for Azure Container Registry and the primary region goes down, and the region is back up the images are replicated automatically.

Please check this document on considerations for using geo-replicated registry. :https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-geo-replication#considerations-for-using-a-geo-replicated-registry

We can create replica in different region and each region in a geo-replicated registry is independent once set up. If one of the replicated region is down, then replication would still run in the background for other region.

If deletion happens on the ACR itself, then all replicas will be deleted as well and that is unrecoverable.

Like for all resources we can create a delete resource lock to prevent accidental deletion
